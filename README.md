# Memory Stress Testing Program

This is a very simple program to allocate and zero out (as to actually claim) memory from a system. Changing the values of constants within the program can alter the amount of memory allocated at each step, the number of steps taken, and so on.

WARNING: Running this program is likely to result in large memory usage! This program is DESIGNED to consume a large volume of memory, and may attempt to consume more memory than your system has available! Your system *should* kill this program if too much memory is used, but no guarantee can be made!
